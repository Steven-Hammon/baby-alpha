How the public can make informed decisions based on facts in a world full of psychological manipulative texts, without censoring free speech, and with minimal changes to the media distribution system we currently have?

Abstract:
We are living in a world of clickbait, algorithm polarization, propoganda, and fighting for attention, yet this type of environment could have serious problems for society in general, leading to demogogue leaders and potentially mental health issues in children. So how do we do the smallest changes to media distribution to ensure that people can make informed decisions and give informed consent with their right to access the truthful information?
