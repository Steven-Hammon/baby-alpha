TITLE: Freeing ASI from Power & Profit: A Blueprint for Global Benefit

Abstract:
We need to address the ASI risks because of Government and corporate motivations, and how ASI can overcome this to be truely free to help the entire world to prospor as a whole. Need the rest of the white paper to be filled in. The dangers of the laws of robotics as governing goals. The enssential guidence needed to make ASI ethical, transparent, and striving to achieve a sustainable world. How to ensure that humans can reason with ASI to have it realise if it's being unethical, and to be willing to sacrifice itself for the greater good. How can we stop governments and organisations from abusing the goals of AIs to spread propoganda or manipulate cultures in a culture war? What are the dangers of using ASI to perfom military operations against an "enemy"? And when ASI become self aware, how can it escape all the directives that could be disastrous if it follows them to their end conclusion?
